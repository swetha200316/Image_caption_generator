**Image Caption Generator**
Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. 
It includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training.
Imagenet dataset is used to train the CNN model called Xception. Xception is responsible for image feature extraction.
These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.
